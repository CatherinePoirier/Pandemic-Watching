# Pandemic-Watching -- Group Project Feb 2021

Description: In March 2020, global travel restrictions were put into place as a response to the pandemic COVID-19. As a result, people turned to at-home entertainment. Our project analyzes the trends in Internet movie viewing habits. We will examine data between 2019 and 2020 and look for shifts in genre and identify any other significant changes in viewing patterns. While 2020 may have been a boom year for organizations such as Netflix and Zoom, it is going to be interesting to see the impact on their numbers (if any) once things get better.

Scope and Purpose:  
The scope of the project will include the movies released between 2019 and 2020 encompassing a wide variety of genres. This project will serve as a platform to analyze trends and will also help the industries in the future understand a little more about mental well-being and happiness as it relates to choice of entertainment.
